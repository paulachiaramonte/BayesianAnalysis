# BayesianAnalysis

Project using the Bayesian Analysis, 
where I implemented a Bayesian inference of Diabetes using the Glucose values and 
implement a Logistic Bayesian Model for calculating the probability of a patient having Diabetes as a 
function of the different diagnostic measurements of each person in the dataset.
